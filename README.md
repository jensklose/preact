# Preact Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) app that can be deployed with Vercel and zero configuration.

_Live Example: https://preact.now-examples.now.sh_

### How We Created This Example

To get started with Preact for deployment with Vercel, you can use the [Preact CLI](https://github.com/preactjs/preact-cli) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ preact create default my-project
```
